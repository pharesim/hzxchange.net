								HZxCHANGE is a distributed cryptocurrency exchange on the Horizon Platform.
							</h2>
							<h2 class="h5style sidertext">
								Unlike traditional exchanges where trading takes place on servers connected to the wallets used for storage, HZxCHANGE uses the Horizon blockchain instead. As well as being much more secure, it's also totally transparent which means that trades can be verified by anybody.
							</h2>
							<h2 class="h5style sidertext">
								All transactions are signed in your browser, the passphrase is never sent to a remote server. Your funds are stored on a multisig address, making it impossible for a single admin to run away with a wallet. The signatures are held by well-known and trusted members of the HZ (or the coin's) community. There's no public facing server a hacker could target, and even if he finds one that's not enough to get access to any coin. The asset balances are snapshotted regularly, so if someone breaches the issuers account we'll just switch to another asset.
